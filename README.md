# H-ear MCP Server

AI-powered sound classification for Claude. Identify sounds, detect noise events, and classify audio across 7,000+ sound classes — from urban noise to bird species.

H-ear connects Claude to the [H-ear World](https://h-ear.world) audio classification API via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @h-ear/mcp-server --key YOUR_API_KEY
```

That's it. Claude now has 14 tools (classification, account, webhooks), a live status resource, and a guided classification prompt.

## Tools

| Tool | Auth | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `classifyAudio` | Key | Classify audio from a file or URL. Async submit + poll. Large files auto-chunked. |
| `classifyBatch` | Key | Batch classify up to 50 files at once. |
| `listClasses` | None | Browse 521+ sound classes across 3 taxonomies (7,000+ including species). |
| `healthCheck` | None | API liveness check — status, version, deployment timestamp. |
| `usage` | Key | API quota: minutes used, calls today, remaining balance. |
| `listJobs` | Key | Recent classification job history with pagination. |
| `getJob` | Key | Detailed job result with all detected sound events. |
| `createWebhook` | Bearer | Create enterprise webhook with event/taxonomy/tier filters. Returns signing secret once. |
| `listWebhooks` | Bearer | List all enterprise webhook registrations. |
| `getWebhook` | Bearer | Get webhook details including filter config and delivery stats. |
| `updateWebhook` | Bearer | Update webhook URL, events, status (active/paused), or filters. |
| `deleteWebhook` | Bearer | Permanently delete a webhook registration. |
| `pingWebhook` | Bearer | Send a test.ping event to verify connectivity and signing. |
| `listWebhookDeliveries` | Bearer | Delivery audit trail with response status and timing. |

Plus:
- **Resource** `h-ear://status` — live API status with taxonomies and class counts
- **Prompt** `classify-audio` — guided workflow with configurable detail level

## Supported Audio

| Formats | Max Size | Max Duration |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A | 25 MB (auto-chunked above) | 10 minutes |

Files over 25 MB are automatically split into overlapping chunks using ffmpeg, classified in parallel, then merged with deduplication.

## Taxonomies

| Taxonomy | Classes | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `audioset-yamnet-521` | 521 | General sound classification (default) |
| `audioset-panns-527` | 527 | Extended general classification |
| `species` | 6,522 | Bird species identification |

## Authentication

Get an API key from [h-ear.world](https://h-ear.world) (Enterprise plan). Pass it via:
- Environment variable: `HEAR_API_KEY`
- CLI flag: `--key YOUR_KEY`
- OAuth 2.1 + PKCE (automatic via claude.ai Connectors Directory — handled by your MCP client)

Two tools (`healthCheck`, `listClasses`) work without authentication.

## Transport

| Transport | Endpoint |
|-----------|----------|
| stdio (npm) | `npx @h-ear/mcp-server --key YOUR_KEY` |
| Streamable HTTP | `https://api.h-ear.world/mcp` |
